I'm a programmer and analyst working for The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. Currently maintaining and developing the [RMINC](https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/RMINC) package for neuroimaging analysis with R, and using it for analyzing data on neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I discovered my passion for computational statistics and data analysis when I began my graduate schooling and was introduced to R. Since then R has become my primary tool for playing with data sets large and small.

These days some of the topics I'm most excited about are: 

1. Workflows for reproducible research
1. Bayesian statistics
1. Automatic differentiation with pure functional programming
1. Causal inference
1. Neuroimaging

I'm always looking for new challenges, if you're in need of a data scientist, neuroinformatician, analyst, neuroinformatician, bioinformatician, or data visualization guy, feel free to drop me a line.
