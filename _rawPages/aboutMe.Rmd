Name: Chris Hammill  
Occupations: Graduate Student, Bioinformatics Research Assistant, Data Visualization Contractor, Blogger


I'm a student at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Canada. I discovered my passion for computational statistics and data analysis when I began my graduate schooling and was introduced to R, my primary tool for working with data big and small. 


Shortly after picking up R, I (along with a colleague) coordinated a seminar/workshop series for biology students and faculty to learn new statistical and computational techniques for working with their data. My background in programming (Java, LISP, various BASICs, and some C++) gave me the tools to quickly master R for scientific analyses. 


 After taking a bioinformatics course and discovering machine learning, I set out to learn as much as I could about modern techniques for synthesizing information from data. Fuelled by passion to share knowledge and a life-long urge to know as much as I possibly can, I began this blog as a motivation to seek answers in data, and share my findings with the world.
