I'm a programmer and analyst working for The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. Currently maintaining and developing the [RMINC](https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/RMINC) package for neuroimaging analysis with R, and using it for analyzing data on neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I discovered my passion for computational statistics and data analysis when I began my graduate schooling and was introduced to R. Since then R has become my primary tool for playing with data sets large and small.

Shortly after picking up R, I (along with a colleague) coordinated a seminar/workshop series for biology students and faculty to learn new statistical and computational techniques for working with their data. My background in programming (Java, LISP, various BASICs, and some C++) gave me the tools to quickly master R for scientific analyses.  After taking a bioinformatics course and discovering machine learning, I set out to learn as much as I could about modern techniques for synthesizing information from data. Fuelled by a passion to share knowledge and a life-long urge to know as much as I possibly can, I began this blog as a motivation to seek answers in data, and share my findings with the world.

I'm always looking for new challenges, if you're in need of a data scientist, neuroinformatician, analyst, statistical ecologist, bioinformatician, or data visualization guy, feel free to drop me a line.
